Remember the FocusRequester: val focusRequester = remember { FocusRequester() }\n   2. Did you forget to add a Modifier.focusRequester() ?\n   3. Are you attempting to request focus during composition? Focus requests should be made in\n   response to some event. Eg Modifier.clickable { focusRequester.requestFocus() }\n"
